ImmDoc.NET
==========
[https://github.com/marek-stoj/ImmDoc.NET][1]

Description
-----------

ImmDoc .NET is a command-line utility for generating HTML documentation from
a set of .NET assemblies and XML files created by the compiler. It's
developed in C#.

  * Simple
  * Light-weight
  * Supports .NET Framework 2.0
  * Can generate HTML and CHM documentation
  * Uses Mono.Cecil

See an [example of documentation generated by ImmDoc.NET][2].

The distinguishing feature of ImmDoc.NET is that unlike Sandcastle or NDoc
it **doesn't require you to have all referenced assemblies**. That is, if you
have a class C1 in assembly A and a class C2 in assembly B and the class C1
has a field of type C2, then you don't need to have the DLL file with
the assembly B to generate documentation.

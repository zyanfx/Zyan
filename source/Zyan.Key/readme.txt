
 This directory contains strong name key file for building Zyan assemblies.
 If the file doesn't exist, it is created automatically during the build process.
 To sign Zyan with your own strong name file, delete all *.snk files in this directory,
 copy your key file and rename it to "zyan.snk".

 Please read the 'Strong-Named Assemblies' topic in MSDN for more information.
